                Overview
            </h2>
            <p>
                The 2022 Audi RS7 is a super-high-performance hatchback that's as 
                audacious as it is luxurious. Puzzled how something so sexy and powerful 
                shares a body style with something as dorky and feeble as a Chevy Spark? 
                Well, as with the A7 and S7 variants that the RS7 is based on, Audi bookends 
                these sleek four-doors with a hatch for added practicality. However, 
                the RS6 Avant wagon is cheaper and roomier. Still, with haunches this 
                broad and a twin-turbo V-8 boasting 591 horsepower, getting noticed and 
                going fast are the RS7's primary objectives. While its explosive thrust 
                causes passengers to involuntarily cuss, and its sharp handling inspires the 
                driver to smile, the hottest of hatches never feels unruly or raw. Instead, its interior exudes 
                expensiveness, pampering riders with rich trappings and ritzy features. As a result, 
                the premium-priced 2022 RS7 is a rapid 
                expression of both driving enthusiasm and wealth.

            <h2>
                Specifications
            </h2>
            <p>
                Power comes from a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that pairs 
                with a 48-volt hybrid system, eight-speed automatic transmission, 
                and Quattro all-wheel drive. All this tech makes the RS7 heavier than the 
                last generation model, which made as much as 605 horsepower. Still, with 
                591 horses and 590 pound-feet of torque, the RS7 we tested rocketed to 60 
                mph in just 3.0 seconds. Want a slightly stronger dose of "holy s**t" 
                acceleration? Try the 617-hp BMW M5 Competition or 603-hp Mercedes-AMC 
                E63 S sedan; both reach 60 mph in 2.9 ticks. The RS7 rides on an air 
                suspension with adaptive settings for varying levels of stiffness. 
                However, it felt refined regardless of the drive mode, and even rolling 
                on our tester's 22-inch rims (21s are standard). It's also rewarding to bend 
                into corners thanks to the poised chassis and the added agility of its 
                standard rear-wheel-steering system. Crazy quick and unerringly comfortable 
                are accurate descriptors of its driving personality. Despite not opting for 
                the carbon-ceramic brakes, which allow its top speed to be increased from 155 
                to 190 mph, the standard stoppers hauled our nearly
                 5000-pound four-door down from 70 mph in an impressive 151 feet.

            <p>
                While the RS model shares an interior design and passenger space 
                with the regular A7, it also has some exclusive details and 
                intriguing options. Of course, the sturdy build quality and upscale 
                materials are immediately recognizable. Still, the RS7's cabin is 
                adorned with trim-specific logos and other unique accents. The standard 
                front sport seats have nice leather upholstery but can be reskinned 
                with upgraded leather and ventilated cushions. Its back seat can fit 
                two or three people, depending on the chosen seat configuration, and 
                its cargo area offers 19 cubic feet of space with the rear seats in use 
                and 49 cubic feet with the rear seats folded.

                The powerful, albeit thirsty, RS7 is expected to earn 15 mpg 
                in the city and 22 mpg on the highway. We ran it on our 75-mph 
                highway fuel-economy route, which is part of our extensive testing 
                regimen, and it returned 23 mpg in the real world. For more information 
                about the RS7's fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.
                Audi is bringing back the RS7, its high-performance A7 variant, 
                and has finally made it known what the slinky, luxurious performance 
                hatchback will cost. The 2021 RS7 will land in dealerships this fall 
                with a $114,995 asking price.
